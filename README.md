This is a small game where you play hide and seek. Your goal is to guess the correct spot in 3 tries. There are 7 hiding spots.

You will be prompted at the start of the game to guess which spot the hider is in. You will get 3 chances to guess right, and extra points will be given for efficiency. Every round the hider will choose a different randomized spot.
